Various notes about things we did to convert this from JIF to VA

All of this turns (mostly) into the JIFHack.java - which produces JIF Hack.jbin - which is loaded into this initial DB.


1) VA Refsets
	- Add via NewConcepts.txt from scratch using any UUIDs
	***CAN BE, but may not buy us anything
	


	
2) VA Allergen Refsets
	- Req:
		- All four components must be released (therefore must be on Rel Cand Path)
		- Rf2 file has refernce to UUID: c439b4b1-ce66-4fa8-bad4-213d56651a81
		
	- Change NewConcepts.txt to state VA Reactants (refset) & VA Refsets as parent
		JIF Reactants (refset)	JIF Reactants	08927a39-5c91-51b0-80bf-42bf0fc9ae46	${projectDevelopmentPathFsn}	TRUE		c439b4b1-ce66-4fa8-bad4-213d56651a81
		VA Allergens (refset)	VA Allergens	08927a39-5c91-51b0-80bf-42bf0fc9ae46	${projectDevelopmentPathFsn}	TRUE		c439b4b1-ce66-4fa8-bad4-213d56651a81

		***Assume that RF2 will handle mulitiple UUIDs in creation of SCTIDs.  
			Must review RF2 files to ensure refset member's point to Refset Concept that is defined in RF2 COn/Desc/Rel with same SCTIDs
		   ... If doesn't work, try above approach of replacing NewConcepts.txt reference to concept (albeit with mainaining existing UUID breaking Type5 UUID generation requirement)
			... Type 5 issue may or may not break process
				... if breaks, need to revisit
			... If this breaks as well, hard-code access to proper uuid in release process to avoid issue
			
			
	
3) VA Module ID
	- Change pom.xml to state VA maintained module (and preferred term as well)
		<projectModuleFsn>JIF maintained module (core metadata concept)</projectModuleFsn>
		*** May be able to change FSN and not UUID
		... BUT SHOULD be able to simply add additional UUID (ie merge concept)


.... Then move all components of these ***THREE*** concepts to the Rel Cand Path




4) Food Concept
	- Add 2nd UUID to Food (substance) concept
	- Remove original Food (CHDR Metadata concept) from NewConcepts.txt
			Food (CHDR metadata)	Food	57b7271f-8bd2-47ac-b515-dd4eb2c49c70	${projectDevelopmentPathFsn}	FALSE		06c17145-5480-4260-9696-fc4d7f259b73
	
		*** Must review RF2 files to ensure refset member's point to reactantId Concept that is defined is the Food (substance) SctId

	
	
... Shouldn't have to re-export Food Concept (ie put on Rel Cand path) b/c we are not making change, just changing members' reactantsId SctId to point totthis instead
	
	
	
A) What is the naming convention for JIF Reactants refset... we created these methods
B) Addional UUIDs don't matter in RF2 or USCRS
